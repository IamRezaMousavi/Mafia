Mafia, also known as Werewolf, is a Russian social deduction game created by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986.
The game models a conflict between two groups:
    - an informed minority (the mafiosi or the werewolves) 
    - an uninformed majority (the villagers)
At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams.
The game has two alternating phases:
    - day-phase
    - night-phase
during which those with night-killing-powers may covertly kill other players,
and second, a day-phase, in which all surviving players debate and vote to eliminate a suspect.
The game continues until a faction achieves its win-condition;
    - for the village, this usually means eliminating the evil minority
    - while for the minority, this usually means reaching numerical parity with the village and eliminating any rival evil groups
