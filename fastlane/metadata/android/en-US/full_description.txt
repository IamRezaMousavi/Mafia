Mafia, also known as Werewolf, is a Russian social deduction game created by Dimitry Davidoff in 1986.
The game models a conflict between two groups:
    - An informed minority (the mafiosi or the werewolves)
    - An uninformed majority (the villagers)

At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams.
The game has two alternating phases:
    - Night-phase: during which those with night-killing-powers may covertly kill other players
    - Day-phase: in which all surviving players debate and vote to eliminate a suspect

The game continues until a faction achieves its win-condition:
    - For the village, this usually means eliminating the evil minority
    - While for the minority, this usually means reaching numerical parity with the village and eliminating any rival evil groups
